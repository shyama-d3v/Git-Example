# Submission: Git Workflow and Conflict Resolution

## Experience

Working on this task was insightful and challenging. It provided an opportunity to:

- Practice creating and managing branches effectively (`feature/user-authenitication` and `bugfix/register-api`).
- Simulate real-world scenarios like conflict resolution during a merge.
- Use Git commands to manage workflows efficiently.

### Highlights

1. **Conflict Resolution**:
   Editing the `user.controller.js` file to manually resolve conflicts between the branches improved my understanding of Git's merge process.

2. **Branch Management**:
   Creating and pushing branches (`feature/user-authenitication` and `bugfix/register-api`) helped the workflow for feature and bug fixes.

Overall, it was a rewarding experience that deepened my knowledge of Git and collaborative workflows.
